# Scraggle
A version of Boggle with Scrabble tile scoring and pair swapping!
Certain "rarer" letters are worth more points, and you can swap one pair per game.

Requires:
- Python 3.5+
- Pygame 2.0+
- Numpy
- Enchant

<b> To Use: </b> <br />
From a terminal, call "python scrabb_switch.py INITIALS", where INITIALS are the initials of the person playing.
Once the game has loaded, press "New Game" to begin.

<b> Playing the game: </b> <br />
Click a starting letter, move the mouse to trace a path along cardinals + diagonals to form a word, and click again.
English words longer than two characters count. Q also counts as Qu, both are tried. Press "Pause" at anytime to take 
a break, and "Quit" to close the game. Press "Save Bank" at any point during a game or on the end screen to save
a .txt file of all the words you've found. Watch the lower message box for tips.
